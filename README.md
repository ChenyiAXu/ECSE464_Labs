# ECSE 464 Power System Analysis - Lab Reports

## Lab Descriptions

### **Lab 1: Transmission Line Steady-State Operation**
- **Objective**: Analyze the steady-state performance of transmission lines, focusing on modeling and evaluating parameters such as impedance, surge impedance loading (SIL), and power stability limits.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Impact of line loading and compensation on voltage profiles.
  - Surge impedance loading as a desirable operational point for efficiency.
  - Influence of line length and resistance on power transfer and losses.

### **Lab 2: Power Flow and Power System Operation**
- **Objective**: Solve power flow problems using numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson) to ensure stable voltage levels and power flows across a 5-bus network.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Techniques to address voltage and MVA limit violations.
  - The role of shunt compensation in voltage regulation.
  - Contingency analysis for single-line outages and operational planning.

### **Lab 3: Fault Analysis**
- **Objective**: Differentiate between symmetrical (three-phase) and asymmetrical faults, using sequence components to model and analyze system behavior.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Worst-case fault scenarios occur at Bus 1 due to its low impedance connection to the slack bus.
  - Symmetrical faults are easier to analyze but less frequent compared to asymmetrical faults.
  - Importance of fault current calculations for designing protection systems.

### **Lab 4: Transient Stability**
- **Objective**: Investigate the dynamic response of a generator-infinite bus system under transient disturbances and determine the critical clearing time for stability.
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Use of the swing equation and equal-area criterion for stability analysis.
  - Damping mechanisms improve stability by mitigating oscillations.
  - Critical clearing time is a key factor in maintaining system synchronism after faults.
